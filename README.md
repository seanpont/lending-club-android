==========================

Lending Club for Android provides the best overview of your account health

## Setup

*Note: These instructions assume you have a Java 1.8 [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) installed.*

To start a new Android project:

1. Install [Android Studio 1.1.0](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).

2. Run the [Android SDK Manager](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/sdk-manager.html) and install
`API 19` and `Build-tools 21.1.2`.

3. Download this project:
    ```bash
    git clone ...
    ```

4. Create a `local.properties` [file](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide#TOC-Simple-build-files) in the root of the project that points to
your SDK installation location. Importing the project into Android Studio (detailed below) will do this for you.

5. In the project directory you should be able to run the Robolectric tests:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew clean test
    ```

6. You should also be able to run the Espresso tests:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew clean connectedAndroidTest
    ```

    Note: Make sure to start an Emulator or connect a device first so the test has something to connect to.

## Android Studio Support

### Compatibility
Deckard gradle is designed to run against Android Studio 1.1.0 with
"Unit Testing support" enabled in Studio's Gradle settings.

### Importing
Import the project into Android Studio by selecting 'Import Project' and selecting the project's `build.gradle`. When prompted, you can just pick the default gradle wrapper.

### Running the Robolectric Test
To run Robolectric tests (example can be found in DeckardActivityTest) open Studio's
"Build Variants" pane and change the "Test Artifact" to "Unit Tests". You can then run
Robolectric tests using the JUnit test runner.

### Running the Espresso Test
To run Robolectric tests (example can be found in DeckardEspressoTest) open Studio's
"Build Variants" pane and change the "Test Artifact" to "Android Instrumentation Tests".
You can then run Espresso tests using the Android test runner.
